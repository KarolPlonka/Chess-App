The package graphics.py is a simple object oriented graphics library designed to make it very easy
for novice programmers to experiment with computer graphics in an object oriented fashion. It was
written by John Zelle for use with the book “Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer
Science” (Franklin, Beedle & Associates). The most recent version of the library can obtained at
http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python. This document is a reference to the functionality provided
in the library. See the comments in the file for installation instructions.
